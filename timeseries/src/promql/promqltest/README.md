# PromQL Test Framework

Implements a Prometheus-inspired promqltest DSL for validating PromQL semantics.

## Architecture

The test framework follows Prometheus's execution model with automatic test discovery:

1. **Entry Point**: `run_all_promql_tests()` in `mod.rs`
2. **Test Discovery**: Scans `testdata/` for `*.test` files
3. **Parser**: `parse_test_file()` in `dsl.rs` parses commands
4. **Executor**: `run_test_with_storage()` executes commands against TSDB
5. **Assertion**: Compares query results against expected values

```
run_all_promql_tests() (mod.rs)
    ↓
run_builtin_tests() (runner.rs)
    ↓
discover_test_files() → *.test files in testdata/
    ↓
parse_test_file() (dsl.rs) → Command objects
    ↓
run_test_with_storage() → execute each command
    ↓
eval_instant() → compare results 
```

### Parser Responsibilities

- The test DSL parser parses only test commands (`load`, `eval`, `clear`).
- PromQL expressions are parsed by the same `promql_parser` crate used by the application.
- This ensures test evaluation uses identical query parsing logic as production code.

## Adding New Tests

Create a `.test` file in `testdata/` - it's automatically discovered at build time.

1. Create `testdata/my_feature.test`
2. Run tests - a `should_pass_my_feature()` function is auto-generated

Tests are generated by `build.rs` which scans `testdata/*.test` files.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all promql tests
cargo test -p opendata-timeseries promql::promqltest::tests

# Run a specific test file
cargo test -p opendata-timeseries promql::promqltest::tests::should_pass_at_modifier
```

## Test File Format

The test format follows [Prometheus's promqltest specification](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/unit_testing_rules/) with two extensions: the `ignore` and `resume` directives.

### Ignore and Resume Directives

The `ignore` directive skips all subsequent commands until `resume` or `clear`. This allows copying test files directly from Prometheus's test suite while marking unimplemented features.

```
# Working features
load 5m
  metric 1 2 3

eval instant at 5m
  metric
    {} 2

# Not yet implemented
ignore

eval instant at 5m
  unimplemented_function(metric)
    {} 42

# Resume testing with same data
resume

eval instant at 10m
  metric
    {} 3
```

**Behavior**:
- `ignore` - Skip all subsequent commands
- `resume` - Stop skipping
- `clear` - Wipe all loaded data (doesn't affect ignore state)

This helps identify the percentage of Prometheus test coverage without modifying upstream test files.

### All Commands

- `load <interval>` - Load time series at specified interval
- `eval instant at <time>` - Execute instant query at timestamp
- `clear` - Wipe all loaded data (doesn't affect ignore state)
- `ignore` - Skip all subsequent commands
- `resume` - Stop skipping commands
